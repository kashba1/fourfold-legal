        <h2>The Challenge: Managing Leads and Cases</h2>
        <blockquote>
          “Before Telecrm, Managing leads & Cases was chaotic & inefficient. 
          <br>
          — Manual process slowed us down; 
          <br>
          Telecrm helped us track the entire customer journey.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Fourfold Legal is a specialized legal consultancy focused on helping individuals resolve loan repayment issues. From initial consultation to legal resolution, it demands clarity and zero miscommunication.
          <br>
          But all of that was being compromised — because every query was being managed manually through Excel sheets.
        </p>

        <h2>Where things started breaking</h2>
        <blockquote>
          “We had leads coming in, calls going out — but no one could tell what happened next. Everything was in silos.”
        </blockquote>

        <div class="steps">
    <div class="step active">
      <div class="arrow shade1"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h3>Two Teams</h3>
        <p>To manage operations, Forefold Legal had split its process between two teams—The Calling Team would speak to clients, qualify leads and The Advocate Team would handle legal resolution post-qualification.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <div class="arrow shade2"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h3>Manual process</h3>
        <p>The entire flow was manual, fragmented and operated entirely on Excel. Leads were downloaded and distributed manually based on loan amount and type — a time-consuming process prone to errors and delays.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <div class="arrow shade3"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h3>Bias on Lead sources</h3>
        <p>Callers also developed bias based on lead sources—they would prioritize leads from certain campaigns and ignore others, assuming some were more “convertible”. This created an imbalance in follow up quality and made it nearly impossible to fairly assess campaign performance.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <div class="arrow shade4"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h3>No visibility</h3>
        <p>There was no visibility into whether calls were actually made, whether follow-ups happened, who paid, or where each lead stood in the funnel. There was lack of visibility into what happened after the lead came in. There was no single dashboard where a manager could track the end-to-end journey of every lead, or see the performance of team members.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

        <p>
          The result? Leads were falling through the cracks, follow‑ups were inconsistent, and the entire process was chaotic. Fourfold Legal needed a solution that could streamline operations, eliminate bias, and provide complete visibility into every lead’s journey.

      <section id="solution" class="solution-section">
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>Fourfold Legal implemented Telecrm by creating two custom workspaces:</p>
        <ul class="solution-intro">
          <li>Calling Team Workspace to handle lead qualification and initial fee collection.</li>
          <li>Legal Team Workspace to manage post‑qualification processes and legal consultations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Here’s what changed:</h3>
        <div class="solution-grid">
          <div class="solution-item">
            <div class="icon icon-lead"></div>
            <h4>Real‑time lead capture & Distribution</h4>
            <p>Lead sources were directly integrated with Telecrm—no manual downloads needed. Leads were automatically assigned to calling agents based on load amounts and case value, turning hours of Excel sorting into seconds.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="solution-item">
            <div class="icon icon-permission"></div>
            <h4>Permission Templates to eliminate lead bias</h4>
            <p>Using permission templates in Telecrm, Fourfold ensured that lead sources are hidden from calling agents—only decision makers can view campaign‑level data. This removed bias and ensured every lead received equal attention and follow‑up.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="solution-item">
            <div class="icon icon-handover"></div>
            <h4>Sales forms ensure smooth handover</h4>
            <p>Custom forms captured all client details upfront, making the transition from callers to advocates seamless—no more lost context or missing information.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="solution-item">
            <div class="icon icon-docs"></div>
            <h4>Centralized Documentation management</h4>
            <p>All case documents and communication logs were stored in one place, giving managers and advocates complete visibility into each lead’s history.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="solution-item">
            <div class="icon icon-docs"></div>
            <h4>Campaign Reporting and feedback loop</h4>
            <p>
              With Telecrm the marketing team could now see:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Which campaigns generated what kind of leads</li>
              <li>How each campaign performed in terms of conversions</li>
              <li>What happened post-lead — where it dropped and why</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This feedback helped them refine targeting, budget allocation, and Ad creatives — something they could never do with their old system.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="solution-item">
            <div class="icon icon-docs"></div>
            <h4>360 Manager visibility and performance insights</h4>
            <p>Managers have a compelete, top-down view of every lead flowing through the system- from the moment it’s captured to final resolution. They can see what happened at eacbh stage, track follow-ups, and monitor lead progress in real-time. Alongside this, they get detailed performance reports on botrh callers and advocates- making it easy to identify gaps, measure effectivemeness, and drive accountability across teams.</p>
